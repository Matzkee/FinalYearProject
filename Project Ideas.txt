Unity AI Game

A game where a team of bots fight agains another team of bots in
a proceduraly generated area. Bots manage their health, ammo and 
take cover as they fight another team.


Unity Escape the house/cave

A game where the main player objective is reaching the exit of the 
house/cave. The area is proceduraly generated and creates another scene 
each time player reaches the exit creating an endless journey. The area 
is patrolled by a team of bots which act as guards and their objective is 
to catch the player thus ending the game. The player has to use covers and 
hideout areas generated by the game in order to not get detected.

In Slavic folklore ‘Leshy’ is considered as a guardian spirit of woodlands and literally means ‘(he) from the forest’. While this spirit is described in many forms it attracts attention when its used as a way to scare children from going deep into forests as they say Leshy abducts children and shares them with ‘Chort’ or ‘The Black One’.
The goal of this project is to design, develop and evaluate a procedural 3D game. A player is challenged to escape the forest guarded by the mysterious woodland spirit. A player must show its cleverness by hiding behind objects, not stepping too quickly and using environment to its advantage. As mentioned the player will face a mysterious spirit which will try to detect the player and chase the player once detected. Since the spirit guards the forest, it also has sound detection which makes it harder to complete. Once the player has reached the end a new scene is going to generate creating another level. The goal is to complete as many levels as possible. In later stages wolves might be added to make it more challenging.
Whole scene is going to be generated procedurally generating bounds, obstacles, passages between bigger rooms and of course lots of trees.
This idea is heavily inspired by titles such as “Slender”, “Alien: Isolation”, “Amnesia: The Dark Descent”, “Soma”. These titles differentiate a lot from this idea, but in common they include the main villain which the players must avoid in order to succeed in the game.
